      <h2>Expression Evaluator (C++23)</h2>
      <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> C++23, STL</p>
      <p>
        Developed a console-based expression evaluator using Dijkstra’s shunting-yard algorithm to convert
        infix expressions to postfix and compute results. Focused on robust input handling, clear error messages,
        and maintainable code structure.
